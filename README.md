# Automation-Project
I have created a hacker rank automation project whose purpose is to add moderators in contests on hacker rank page automatically without handling the website  manually.
To run this project execute the following:
node 1_HackerrankAutomation.js --url=https://www.hackerrank.com --config=config.json
